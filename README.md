# NXP_LPC804_Interfacing_MCUXpresso
1. LPC804 EVK Interfacing codes with LED Displays and ADC.
2. Source codes are stored in the folder named "source" obviously :)
3. test.c is the code I develpoed at the end of the Intefacing 4-digit, 7-segment display and led_blinky.c is the code that I used for the testing purpose.
