# NXP_LPC804_Interfacing_MCUXpresso
This is the first part of my project where I have to interface 4-digit 7-segment display with LPC804 EVK.
1. LPC804 EVK Interfacing codes with LED Displays and ADC.
2. Source codes are stored in the folder named "source" obviously :)
3. test.c is the code I develpoed at the end of the Intefacing 4-digit, 7-segment display and led_blinky.c is the code that I used for the testing purpose.

I have done ADC interfacing also, you can refer NXP_LPC804_ADC_Interfacing repository for that :)
